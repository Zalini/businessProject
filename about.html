		<h2>Meet Matcha</h2>
		<p>Meet matcha, the current darling of the tea world. This finely milled green tea powder the staple ingredient upon which traditional Japanese tea ceremonies were built in the 12th century has seen a surge in popularity recently thanks to its visual appeal, purported health benefits, and beautiful, distinct flavor. Matcha is essentially processed green tea leaves that have been stone-ground into a delicate powder. The powder is then sifted and whisked with hot water</p>

	<h2>Why drink tea?</h2>
		<p>People have been drinking tea for centuries also because of its health effects. Much research suggests drinking tea,particularly green tea, can fight diseases and even lengthen life. This is due to tea's high concentration of antioxidants called polyphenols, which may contribute to the prevention of cancer, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases. While polyphenols are also found in abundance in fruits, vegetables, and grains and also coffee in even higher amounts tea is especially and uniquely rich in particular types of polyphenols called catechins (specifically, EGCG) that may be the most powerful ones of all.</p>
